# UGV_SURVALLIANCE_OBJECTDETECTION

The UGV based Surveillance solution system is a deep learning-based object detection
model which will help us to detect the anomalies the society and take the necessary action.


                                           Problem statement   

To Create an AI solution for surveillance using rover or UGV and to implement
following use cases.
• To detect mob (illegal) activities and inform police.
• To detect disasters (like fire, smoke, etc..) and send details to concerned authorities.
• To detect a health emergency (accident, etc..) and take emergency action (call an
ambulance and to alert the nearest hospital) for help.


 
                                            PROPOSED SOLUTION 

The solution proposed here is an UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) based Surveillance
(Unmanned Ground Vehicle) can be implemented to perform above mention use cases .In
cases one if UGV detects any mob(illegal) activities at a particular location it will take photos
or video for the evidence and send the police the current location where the mob activities
are taking place, the second use case is if UGV detects any natural or human made disasters
(fire,smoke,etc..) the UGV detects with its sensors and will send details to concerned
authorities and the final use case of UGV is if it finds any health emergency (accident, etc..)it
will take emergency action (call ambulance and alert the nearest hospital )for emergency
help.
